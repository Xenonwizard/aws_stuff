Fargate is like running a docker in a vm.
usually we create ECR

Step 1:
Create ECS first
Create a task definition
Create a cluster(u dont need this if u have fargate)
service (load balancing)
tasks
Task definition is to tell ECS which VM to use.

ECS instances is the number of EC2 using ECS(if u are using fargate dont need to check)
Tasks is the container itself.
